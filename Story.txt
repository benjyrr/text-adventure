Story:

You wake up in a cold, dark, metal box. It's a prison! You don't want to be here; time to make a weapon you can use to escape. Will you put bar soap into a sock?

You wrap the sock around itself and stuff it into your pocket. Later, the guards let you out of your cell for breakfast. You walk to the dining area with the other prisoners. You won't miss the gross food and lousy company when you're out of here.
Breakfast time is over and now you have free time. Walking around the prison you notice a guard by themself with their back turns toward you. Will you sneak up and swing the sock across their head?

You put the keys and your other pocket. The guard passes out and you look around to if anyone saw. You see a couple of prisoners staring at you from a distance, but they don't say anything. Do you take the guards' keys and hide his body?

You drag the guard to a nearby laundry room and close the door. A guard comes up to you as you walk out and asks what you were doing in there because you don't do the laundry. Do you say "I was doing the laundry anyway" or "I just signed up to do have the laundry job?"

The guard approves of your response and walks away. You then go sign up for the laundry job to make sure you don't get caught. Satisfied with your work, you wait until its lights out to make your escape. At the end of the day, the guards escort you to your cell, lock the door, and leave you. Do you open your door with your new keys?
