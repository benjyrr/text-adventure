You wrap the sock around itself and stuff it into your pocket. Later, the guards let you out of your cell for breakfast. You walk to the dining area with the other prisoners. You won't miss the gross food and lousy company when you're out of here.
Breakfast time is over and now you have free time. Walking around the prison you notice a guard by themself with their back turns toward you. Will you sneak up and swing the sock across their head?
